# base.table
The chrTable.by.4group function takes data and creates a table for baseline characteristics stratified by 4 groups. Both categorical and numerical variables are included and analyzed together. P
values will be bolded in the Markdown document if it is less than 0.05. The Table can be displayed in a tidy form using a `kable` function. To install the package using R, run the command below.
```
library(remotes)
remotes::install_github("statwork/base.table")
```
